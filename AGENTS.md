## Development

When starting the dev server, use background mode:

```
astro dev --background
```

Manage the background server with `astro dev stop`, `astro dev status`, and `astro dev logs`.

## Testing

Every change that adds or modifies code must include unit tests. Cover as many scenarios as practical:

- **Happy path:** the expected, valid behavior.
- **Negative scenarios:** invalid input, missing or unknown values, and failure paths. Assert that the code rejects them or falls back as intended.
- **Edge cases:** empty values, boundaries (first/last, min/max, zero, one, many), unusual characters (accents such as `é`/`ñ`, emoji, very long strings), and every supported locale (`es`, `en`).

Rules:
- Keep tests next to the code they cover or under `tests/`, named `*.test.ts`.
- A bug fix starts with a failing test that reproduces the bug.
- If something is genuinely hard to unit-test (for example pure Astro markup), extract the logic into a plain TypeScript function and test that; note any remaining gap in the PR.
- Tests, `npm run check` and `npm run build` must all pass before a change is considered done.
